# RejectedAgainOS
A personal operating system project built with Rust.

As someone with dyslexia, rapid-fire technical interviews have always been a challenge—questions come fast, and I need time to think, process, and respond clearly. Instead of getting stuck in that loop, I decided to channel my knowledge into something tangible: building an OS.

RejectedAgainOS is my way of learning Rust while turning years of software engineering experience into a real system. It’s not just code—it’s a quiet rebellion against rejection, a playground for ideas, and a step toward mastering low-level systems programming.

## This project is my personal lab to:
- Learn Rust in a deep, systems-level context
- Explore low-level concepts like bootloading, memory management, and hardware interfacing
- Channel my knowledge into something creative, concrete, and fully mine

RejectedAgainOS isn’t about reinventing Linux. It’s about understanding how computers really work, owning my pace of learning, and proving that rejection doesn’t define capability.

## It will includes:
- A minimal bootloader
- VGA text output
- Panic handler
- Support for no_std and no_main Rust
- Interrupts
- Memory paging
- Simple task scheduler
